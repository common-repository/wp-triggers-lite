It’s amazing what you can do with one little box.  WP Triggers Lite creates interactive trigger boxes.

== Description ==
Client: “Can you make it just a bit more interactive?”  
You: “UUUmmm, what did you have in mind?” [secretly hoping that they don’t say something you can’t do!] 

Here’s why it’s awesome: WP Triggers is the only plugin that creates interactive Trigger Boxes

Unless you are one of thousands of people that have used WP Triggers, that probably doesn’t mean much, but here are just of the potential uses for WP Triggers:

Virtual Scavenger Hunt
Create a simple Zip Code search
Help authors sell more books
Download an ebook
Show special text
Play a secret video
and a lot more

We’ve even created a bunch of video tutorials showing you exactly how to create them: http://www.wptriggers.com/ideas/

Just a note: while this is the Lite version of WP Triggers, some of the more advanced uses will require a $15 upgrade that can be purchased here: http://www.wptriggers.com/upgrade 

= What is a Trigger Box? =

A Trigger Box is the first thing visitors see on a page, at first glance it's just a simple white box. What comes next creates a connection like no other. 

Each Trigger Box is connected to a world of possibility. You'll be able to show text, documents, videos and more with just one little trigger. - See more at: http://www.wptriggers.com/ideas/
